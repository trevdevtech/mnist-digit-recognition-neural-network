# mnist-digit-recognition-neural-network
This neural network is capable of obtaining an 88% accuracy for recognizing digits after nearly 25 spochs the training data set. The network takes a stochastic approach to gradient descent where back propogation is done on a per batch basis.

## Usage
python3 driver.py [training-data] [epochs] [learning-rate]

## Run/Execute
```bash
python3 driver.py optdigits-mod.txt 100 2
```
